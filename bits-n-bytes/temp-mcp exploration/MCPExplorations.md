## Exploration

# See what happens when I leave you kids alone!?!?!

Anthropic dropped MCP on 11/2024, itâ€™s a [discoverable] protocol for connecting Agents to external data and tools.

Just google on MCP & Insane, you'll likely be excited about it as I am !!

TLDR: this is a tectonic shift for agents - get ready to hang on - AI just took a Huuuuuuuge step forward

Nearly every video you watch will be using n8n (a workflow tool that's been around for several years)

This repo gives it to you in Docker with Puppeteer and Playwright already installed (and working soon I hope !!!)

Have fun !!
